# Spam Filter of Emails 
Spam filter using Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier by count vectorization and TF-IDF.

## Findings:
- Count vectorization worked better than TF-IDF.
- Words that are most repetitive in spam and ham messages are a clear classifier.
- By TF-IDF we would be decreasing the importance of this.
- Also, it is caused by previously removing stop words.
- Different data set has different tools to be used like in our case the most common tf-idf was performing lower than count vectorization.
